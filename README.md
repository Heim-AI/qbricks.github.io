## Welcome to Qbricks

Qbricks is open-source environment for formally verified quantum programming. Embedded in the [http://why3.lri.fr/](Why3) deductive verification environment, it enables the writing of quantum circuit building programs, specified with their I/O functions and/or their resource requirements, and their automated verification.

It is developed at the [http://www-list.cea.fr/en/](CEA List) institute of [https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en](Universit√© Paris-Saclay in collaboration with [https://lmf-paris-saclay.fr/newsite/](LMF).

Please read our [ESOP 21 article](https://github.com/Qbricks/Qbricks/files/6414099/final--ESOP-2021.pdf) for a longer introduction to Qbricks. A tutorial redaction is under progress.
