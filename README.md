## Welcome to Qbricks

Qbricks is open-source environment for formally verified quantum programming. Embedded in the [Why3](http://why3.lri.fr/) deductive verification environment, it enables the writing of quantum circuit building programs, specified with their I/O functions and/or their resource requirements, and their automated verification.

It is developed at the [CEA LIST](http://www-list.cea.fr/en/) institute of [Universit√© Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) in collaboration with [LMF](https://lmf-paris-saclay.fr/newsite/).

Please read our [final--ESOP-2021.pdf](https://github.com/Qbricks/qbricks.github.io/files/6414263/final--ESOP-2021.pdf) for an introduction to Qbricks. A tutorial redaction is under progress.
